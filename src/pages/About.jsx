                  Hi, I'm Nadish. I approach wedding photography differentlyâ€”while others orchestrate moments, I believe the best shots happen when you forget I'm there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is your day, and I'm here to document every genuine emotion as it unfolds naturally. I work collaboratively with you and everyone involved to capture the authentic story of your celebration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My style is documentary-focused, emphasizing real moments over posed perfection. The result is a collection of images that feel timeless and transport you back to exactly how your wedding day felt.
                </p>
