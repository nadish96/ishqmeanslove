Here’s my honest, user‑eye review plus crisp improvements.

First Impression

Premium shift: The wordmark + Newsreader body + clay accents feel elevated.
Clear promise: The new intro copy is strong and personal; it sets intent fast.
Visual focus: The curated highlights grid immediately showcases quality.
What Works

Typography: Cormorant + Newsreader reads editorial and serious.
Grid: No-crop, lightbox, and 3‑across layout present images beautifully.
CTA placement: Below work feels earned and not salesy.
Footer: Now compact, clear, and tasteful.
Friction / Misses

Hero load: The hero still probes multiple images; can add initial jank and hurt LCP.
SEO basics: Only a bare <title> is set; no meta description or OG/Twitter tags.
Favicon: Still vite.svg; breaks the premium feel.
Console logs: HeroImage.jsx logs to console; noisy in production.
Alt text: PhotoGrid uses generic “Photo x-y”; misses accessibility + SEO upside.
Link palette: Some text-gray-600 remains in nav/UI (intended), but ensure it’s a deliberate hierarchy.
Quick Wins (I can do fast)

Performance: Preload a single hero still image and defer others; keep carousel logic but only if needed.
SEO: Add meta description + OG/Twitter tags matching the new voice.
Favicon: Replace vite.svg with a simple I monogram or your logo.
Cleanup: Remove console.log lines from HeroImage.jsx.
A11y: Improve alt text on highlights (derive from filename or let you pass captions).
Optional Polishes

Full‑bleed highlights: Let the grid go edge‑to‑edge for more impact.
Breadcrumbs on blog detail: “Weddings / Blog / {Title}” (tiny, elegant).
Micro-copy align: Mirror the poetic tone on About and a single sentence in footer.
If you want, I’ll:

Add SEO/meta + favicon.
Replace hero with one powerful still (faster, cleaner).
Improve alt text strategy for PhotoGrid.
